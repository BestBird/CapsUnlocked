# CapsUnlocked

This is a complete solution for windows to map the CapsLock key to Control and Escape without losing the ability to toggle CapsLock

* Use CapsLock as Escape if it's the only key that is pressed and released within 300ms (configurable)
* Use CapsLock as LControl when used in conjunction with some other key or if it's held longer than 300ms
* Toggle CapsLock by pressing LControl+CapsLock
